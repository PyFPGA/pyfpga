# PyFPGA Examples

In this section, you will find:

* `projects`: basic but complete examples for each supported tool.
* `helpers`: examples of the PyFPGA helpers.
* `hooks`: how to use this feature.
* `misc`: miscellaneous examples.

For an example where all the tools are employed based on the same code, you can check
[support.py](../tests/support.py) (located under the [tests](../tests) directory).
