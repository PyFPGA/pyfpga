PyFPGA is an abstraction layer for working with FPGA development tools in a vendor-agnostic, programmatic way. It is a Python package that provides:
* One **class** per supported tool for **project creation**, **synthesis**, **place and route**, **bitstream generation**, and **programming**.
* A set of **command-line helpers** for simple projects or quick evaluations.

With PyFPGA, you can create your own FPGA development workflow tailored to your needs!

Some of its benefits are:
* It provides a unified API between tools/devices.
* It's **Version Control Systems** and **Continuous Integration** friendly.
* It ensures reproducibility and repeatability.
* It consumes fewer system resources than GUI-based workflows.

## Basic example

```py
from pyfpga import Vivado

prj = Vivado('example')
prj.set_part('xc7z010-1-clg400')
prj.add_vlog('location1/*.v')
prj.add_vlog('location2/top.v')
prj.add_cons('location3/example.xdc')
prj.set_top('Top')
prj.make()
```

The next steps are to read the [docs](https://pyfpga.github.io/pyfpga) or take a look at [examples](examples).

## Support

PyFPGA is a Python package developed having GNU/Linux platform on mind, but it should run well on any POSIX-compatible OS, and probably others!
If you encounter compatibility issues, please inform us via the [issues](https://github.com/PyFPGA/pyfpga/issues) tracker.

For a comprehensive list of supported tools, features and limitations, please refer to the [tools support](https://pyfpga.github.io/pyfpga/tools.html) page.

> **NOTE:**
> PyFPGA assumes that the underlying tools required for operation are ready to be executed from the running terminal.
> This includes having the tools installed, properly configured and licensed (when needed).

## Installation

PyFPGA requires Python>=3.8.

At the moment, it's only available as a git repository hosted on GitHub. It can be installed with pip:

```
pip install 'git+https://github.com/PyFPGA/pyfpga#egg=pyfpga'
```

Alternatively, you can get a copy of the repository either through git clone or downloading a tarball/zipfile, and then:

```
git clone https://github.com/PyFPGA/pyfpga.git
cd pyfpga
pip install -e .
```

> With `-e` (`--editable`) your application is installed into site-packages via a kind of symlink.
> That allows pulling changes through git or changing the branch, avoiding the need to reinstall the package.
