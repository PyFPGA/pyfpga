Development Notes
#################

To install a local clone of the repository (for development):

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://gitlab.com/rodrigomelo9/pyfpga.git
   cd pyfpga
   sudo pip install -e .

.. NOTE::
  With `-e` (`--editable`) your application is installed into site-packages
  via a kind of symlink, so you do not need to reinstall it after changes.

PyFPGA uses PEP8 guidelines.

The following is an overview of the main PyFPGA components and its
relationship, which is explained in the sub-sections of this document.

fpga/tool/template.tcl
======================

Many (all?) FPGA development Tools provides a Tcl (Tool Command Language)
interface for the Bitstream generation.
This multi-vendor master Tcl was developed, where the different commands to
solve the complete workflow were encapsulated into procedures
(using the ``fpga_*`` prefix to avoid namespace conflicts).

.. NOTE::
  To add a new Tool, a *case* in the *switch* of each ``fpga_*`` must be
  provided.

.. NOTE::
  This file is compliant with Tcl 8.4 because is the oldest used by a
  supported FPGA Tool (Xilinx ISE).

fpga/tool/<TOOL>.py
===================

A base class (``__init__.py``) was developed to provides a uniform API to be
implemented for each supported Tool.
Also, validation of values is performed here.

Classes to supports each Tool (``<TOOL>.py``) implements the base class, ideally
setting a few variables.

.. NOTE::
  Transfer of the bitstream to a device is not always performed by a Tcl
  script, so special methods must be developed, following the proposed API.

fpga/project.py
===============

This class implements the Application Programming Interface (API) which is
employed to manage an FPGA project. It solves high-level things such as
collect several files using glob, setting and use of a working/output
directory and time measurement.

How to deal with deprecated Tcl commands?
-----------------------------------------

From Vivado 2019.1 to 2019.2, ``open_hw`` changed to ``open_hw_manager``:
``if { [ catch { open_hw_manager } ] } { open_hw }``
