Multi project managment
=======================

.. code-block:: python

   PROJECTS = {
       '<NAME1>': Project(
           '<TOOLNAME>',
           '<PROJECTNAME>',
           {
               'outdir': '<DIRNAME>',
               'part': '<PARTNAME>'
               'paths': [
                   '<PATHNAME1>',
                   ...
                   '<PATHNAMEn>'
               ],
               'vhdl': [
                   ['<FILENAME1>', '<LIBRARYNAME1>'],
                   '<FILENAME2>',
                   ...

               'verilog': [

                   ...
                   '<FILENAMEn>'
               ],
               'constraint': [
                   '<FILENAME1>',

               },

Hooks
=====

The following table depicts the parts of the *Project Creation* and the
*Design Flow* internally performed by PyFPGA.

+--------------------------+----------------------+
| Project Creation         | Design Flow          |
+==========================+======================+
| Part specification       | **preflow** hook     |
+--------------------------+----------------------+
| **prefile** hook         | Synthesis            |
+--------------------------+----------------------+
| Files addition           | **postsyn** hook     |
+--------------------------+----------------------+
| Top specification        | Implementation       |
+--------------------------+----------------------+
| Parameters specification | **postimp** hook     |
+--------------------------+----------------------+
| **project** hook         | Bitstream generation |
+--------------------------+----------------------+
|                          | **postbit** hook     |
+--------------------------+----------------------+

If the provided API if not enough or suitable for your project, you can
specify additional *hooks* in different parts of the flow, using:

.. code-block:: python

   prj.add_hook(hook, phase)

.. NOTE::

  * Valid vaues for *phase* are ``prefile``, ``project`` (default), ``preflow``,
    ``postsyn``, ``postimp`` and ``postbit``.
  * The *hook* string must be a valid command (supported by the used tool).
  * If more than one *hook* is needed in the same *phase*, you can call this
    method several times (the commands will be executed in order).

Parameters
==========

The generics/parameters of the project can be optionally changed with:

.. code-block:: python

   prj.set_param('param1', value1)
   ...
   prj.set_param('paramN', valueN)

Generate options
================

The method ``generate`` (previously seen at the end of
[Basic usage](#basic-usage) section) has optional parameters:

.. code-block:: python

   prj.generate(to_task, from_task, capture)

With *to_task* and *from_taks* (with default values ``bit`` and ``prj``),
you are selecting the first and last task to execute when `generate` is
invoqued. The order and available tasks are ``prj``, ``syn``, ``imp`` and ``bit``.
It can be useful in at least two cases:

* Maybe you created a file project with the GUI of the Tool and only want to
  run the Design Flow, so you can use: ``generate(to_task='bit', from_task='syn')``

* Despite that a method to insert particular commands is provided, you would
  want to perform some processing from Python between tasks, using something
  like:

.. code-block:: python

   prj.generate(to_task='syn', from_task='prj')
   #Some other Python commands here
   prj.generate(to_task='bit', from_task='syn')

In case of *capture*, it is useful to catch execution messages to be
post-processed or saved to a file:

.. code-block:: python

   result = prj.generate(capture=True)
   print(result)

In case of *capture*, it is useful to catch execution messages to be
post-processed or saved to a file.

Exceptions
==========

Finally, you must run the bitstream generation or its transfer. Both of them
are time-consuming tasks, performed by a backend tool, which could fail.
Exceptions are raised in such cases, that should be ideally caught to avoid
abnormal program termination.

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       prj.generate()
       prj.transfer()
   except Exception as e:
       print('{} ({})'.format(type(e).__name__, e))

And wait for the backend Tool to accomplish its task.
