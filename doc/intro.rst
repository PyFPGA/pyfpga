Introduction

Detailed support
----------------

.. ATTENTION::

  PyFPGA assumes that the backend Tool is ready to run.
  This implies, depending on the operating system, things such as:

  * Tool installed.
  * A valid License configured.
  * Tool available in the system PATH.
  * GNU/Linux: extra packages installed, environment variables assigned
    and permissions granted on devices (to transfer the bitstream).

Next Steps
----------

From here, you can read the :ref:`basic` and :ref:`advanced` sections, check
the detailed :ref:`api` or start with the available :repo:`Examples <examples>`.
