## History

The roots of this project date back to 2015, where a project called fpga_tools had Perl scripts to populate templates for the ISE tool.

In 2016 the project was renamed as fpga_helpers, changing Perl by Python and adding support for Vivado, Quartus and time after for Libero-SoC. The project evolved to a Makefile and two Tcl scripts, one for Synthesis and other for Programming, and a bunch of scripts to automate tasks.

At the end of 2019, a new project called pyfpga, superseded the previous one, where the Makefile and the Tcl scripts were replaced by a class to be used in Python scripts.
